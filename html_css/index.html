            <h2> Since Its almost Halloween I want to talk some about it </h2>
            <p> Halloween originated from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, celebrated around November 1st to mark
                the end
                of summer and the harvest. The Celts believed this was a time when the boundary between the worlds of
                the living
                and the dead blurred, and ghosts of the dead returned to Earth. To ward off spirits, they would light
                bonfires
                and wear costumes. The holiday was later influenced by Christianity, with the evening before All Saints'
                Day
                becoming known as All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween. </p>

    <h3>How its changed</h3>
    <hr>

    <hr>
    <p> Halloween has changed majorly over the years, what used to be a ancient festival has now turned into a night
        where children dress up in costumms and go house to ask for candy. This tradition has occourd due to traditions
        that combined ancient practices of disguising oneself and appeasing spirits with later customs of "souling" and
        "guising". Initially, costumes were worn to ward off or blend in with spirits, while the tradition of asking for
        food or treats evolved from the "souling" practice, where people would pray for the dead in exchange for food
        gifts. Over time, this evolved into the modern "trick-or-treating," where the threat of a trick is exchanged for
        a treat, often candy. </p>
