                <h2> For this final project Ill be explaining one of my faviorate games.</h2>
                <p> Ghost of Tsushima is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Sucker Punch Productions and
                    published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The player controls Jin Sakai, a samurai on a quest to
                    protect Tsushima Island during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. Jin must choose between following
                    the warrior code to fight honorably, or by using practical but dishonorable methods of repelling the
                    Mongols with minimal casualties. The game features a large open world which can be explored either
                    on foot or on horseback. When facing enemies, the player can choose to engage in a direct
                    confrontation using Jin's katana or to use stealth tactics to assassinate opponents. A multiplayer
                    mode titled Ghost of Tsushima: Legends was released in October 2020 and made available separately in
                    September 2021.
